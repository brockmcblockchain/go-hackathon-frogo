  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>Fro-GO utilises blockchain technology and all incentives are made through the crypto currency GoChain(GO). To use the tool you first need to set up a wallet, this is where your incentive payments will live once you have purchased from an exchange. Your child will also need a wallet to receive the incentive payments but the process is very quick and can be done on their behalf. Once created you can then access your account <em>(it will be generated automatically from your wallet)</em>.</p>
<p>Now your account is set up you can link to your child’s wallet and then assign tasks with incentives that you decide upon. Your child can then complete the task and then once completed they can request your acceptance and you confirm – That’s it!</p>
<p>There are many further options available in the tool such as the enabling of incentive erosion to encourage rapid completion of tasks, global tasks that allows multiple task assignees to work together to complete.</p>
<p>Incentives when received can be used for many things. They can be simply held as an investment in the GoChain network, they can be used to purchase items at partner stores <em>(coming soon – Fro-GO discounted store)</em> they can be used at one of the many other applications that use Go or they can be exchanged back to local currencies.</p>

  <h3>Why <b>GoChain</b></h3>
  <p>Fro-GO uses GoChain as it is dedicated to delivering a blockchain that is not only fast and cost effective but also has a significantly reduced burden on the environment when compared to the more common blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The socially conscious approach to the technology means that we can put more value into your child’s hands without costing the Earth!</p>
