  <h3>Buying Go</h3>
  <p>Fro-GO is powered by the cryptocurrency GO which can be purchased via many exchanges. This is similar to purchasing foreign currency when travelling abroad but the benefit of using GO is that it enables smart contracts to manage rewards for your child, the impact the currency has on the environment and the speed in which it can transfer. Once a child has completed a task and you have confirmed it has been done, they will receive their GO instantly.</p>
  <p>There are a variety of exchanges available to purchase GO. To use them for the first time you will be required to go through a "KYC" process (know your customer). This can take a few days depending on the exchange. Links to each exchange can be found below.</p>
